## Evolution Kits

Evolution Kits are devices and instruction for a rapid evolutionary
process essential for a terraforming process.

Developed by the APRI mother-corporation as a weapon in a "Scorched
Earth" scenario, the Evolution Kit has shown a great potential in
reversing the same scenario and for terraforming in the APRI Project.

Every Evolution Kit consists of a specialized quantum computer,
instructions and genetic algorithms to change the surrounding area into
almost anything. It is also self-replicating and especially for the
APRI Project the replication has been fitted with a subset of mutating
coroutines to adapt the consecutive Evolution Processes to the
environment provided.

## How to apply a Evolution Kit in 1 Easy step

The APRI's modified body can hold upto 10 Evolution Kits at one time.
An Evolution Kit can be set onto any surface to start a scan of the
surrounding resources. The Evolution kit will emit a blinking orange
light during this step.
Please note that the top side of the Evolution Kit should face upwards,
gravity is not a necessity for the Evolution Kit but proved to have a
positive effect on the processes executed by the Evolution Kit.
If the surrounding resources prove not to be sufficient the emitted
light will change into a constant red light.
Please note that in surroundings where colours cannot be distinguished
the scanning process is blinking, a failure is a constant light, while
a transformation in progress will increase/decrease its intensity slowly
in a 10 second cycle.
During the transformation process has succeeded the Evolution Kit will
be consumed and Mutated Evolution Kits will be produced within a
timespan no less than 10% and no more than 25% of the transformation
process.
