## Terraforming - Quantum computing meets biomatter

The following document explains the computations most likely executed
during a terraforming process of an Evolution Kit.
Please note that quantum mechanics are used in the computing unit
and the biomatter storage is of a mutatable nature. Due to this the
computations executed by the Evolution Kit may vary greatly and even
fail.


## The interfaces of the Evolution Kit

The Evolution Kit has following co-routines:

* Markable
* Growable
* Consuming
* Reproducing
* Liquifying
* Hardening
* Transparent
* Transforming
* Scorable

Co-routines are easily modifyable and extendable by the expirenced user,
please refer to APRI Document #25132 for detailed instructions.


## A Evolution Kit interface in detail

When plugging a interface to the Evolution Kit framwork a positioning
information must be provided as the co-routines of the Evolution Kit
won't be called simultaneously.

Every interface of the evolution kit must provide a `apply` method.
This method must accept a `chunk` of data containing detailed binary
information of the previous results in the previous steps of the
Evolution Kit quantum computation.

The final computed chunk will be applied to the surrounding area,
required resources will be consumed and the biomatter processor will be
activated to create new, evolved versions of the evolution kit.
