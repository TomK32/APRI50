## The game

You are playing *Angelica S. Smith*, highly trained scientist with a few
biomechanic modifications, who was sent here as part of humanity's
search for _new planets to colonize_. 

After you arrival in orbit with in a tiny hyperspace caspule you have
successfully landed on the planet. In a barren landscape shaped by
regular and unhealty rainfall you need to _establish a base and start exploring_.

*What will you find and will your mission be a success?*

automatic blueprints to extend your base. In small domes you will be
