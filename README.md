## The game

*ApriL* or *APRI50* is a exploration game set on a planet in a nearby solar system.

You are playing *Angelica Smith*, highly trained scientist with a few
biomechanic modifications, who was sent here as part of humanity's
search for _new planets to colonize_. 

After your arrival in orbit in a hyperspace ship you have
successfully landed on the planet. In a barren landscape shaped by
regular and unhealty rainfall you need to _establish a base and start exploring_.

*What will you find and will your mission be a success?*


## Game play

The game focuses around a crashed space ship and colonists. These are
controlled by the player and will conduct the terraforming, engineering
and other thing necessary to turn the planet into a successful colony.


## Controls

You have an inventory of evolution kits which you can _select_ with the
number keys `1..0` or by clicking them in the inventory bar.
When you've selected one evo kit you may _mutate_ or or _recycle_ it by
pressing `m` or `r`
