## The game

*ApriL* or *APRI50* is a exploration game set on a planet in a nearby solar system.

You are playing *Angelica Smith*, highly trained scientist with a few
biomechanic modifications, who was sent here as part of humanity's
search for _new planets to colonize_. 

After your arrival in orbit in a tiny hyperspace capsule you have
successfully landed on the planet. In a barren landscape shaped by
regular and unhealty rainfall you need to _establish a base and start exploring_.

*What will you find and will your mission be a success?*


## Controls

You have an inventory of evolution kits which you can _select_ with the
number keys `1..0` or by clicking them in the inventory bar.
When you've selected one evo kit you may _mutate_ or or _recycle_ it by
pressing `m` or `r`

To make a screenshot press `F2`.

Toggle the game's debug mode by pressing `F3`.

Press `F4/F5` to increase/decrese the debug level for the map, this
independent from the `F3` debug mode.
