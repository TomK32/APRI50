You are playing Angelica Smith, highly trained scientist with a few biomechanic modifications, who was sent here as part of humanityâ€™s search for new planets to colonize.\r\n\r\nAfter your arrival in orbit in a hyperspace ship you have successfully landed on the planet. In a barren landscape shaped by regular and unhealty rainfall you need to establish a base to start exploring and terraforming.\r\n\r\nThe terraforming comes with a twist: Machines with a biological intelligence are used for the processes and to make it more tricky the machines do have their own unique DNA, controlling their actions and features.","google":"UA-1127310-7","note":"Don't delete this file!
